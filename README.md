# RAG-system-using-pinecone-database-
In this project I have created a RAG system using Pinecone database which refers to a text file. This text file has the data/info for RAG. This entire data has been splitted into smaller chunk with size 500,these chunks are converted into embeddings using openAI embeddings and stored into vectore database that is pinecone in this case. Now when user asks any question to this system it will first converted into embeddings and then by using similarity search RAG will search for related data once the related data as per user query is found then the response is sent back to the user.
